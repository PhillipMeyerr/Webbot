# Create a project using selenium to automate the cookie clicker game. The project should be able to click the big cookie and buy products. The project should have the following features:
# The bot will win and the game will end when the following conditions are met:
# The bot has bought 10 cursors.
# The bot has bought 8 grandmas.
# The bot has bought 6 farms.
# The bot has bought 4 mines.
# The bot has bought 2 factories.
# Figure out how get check the id of either upgrades or the products and then if their class name is create upgrade enabled then click on them.
# Also then maybe get something to print if clickable so like if I look at the products offering and see that the product is clickable then I can click on it.
